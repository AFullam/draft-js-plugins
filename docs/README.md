## Wait, but why?

Facebook's rich-text editor framework [DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/) built on top of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) allows you to create powerful editors. We're building a plugin architecture on top of it that aims to provide you with plug & play extensions. It comes with a set of plugins with great UX serving mobile & desktop as well as screen-readers. You can combine them in any way you want or build your own.
